            <p><strong>Health Cost Negotiator</strong> is a project by <a href="http://www.coseppi.com" title="Coseppi Partnership" target="_blank">Coseppi Partnership</a> (James Seppi and Taylor Cook).</p>

            <p>
            	Consumers paying hospital bills out of pocket are often confronted with prices from a hospital's charge master. The charge master is a list of charges generated by a hospital that often has little relation to the actual cost of a service or product. Rather, it is a tool that hospitals use to negotiate prices with public and private health insurers. When consumers know that hospital charges are negotiable and know what deals other payors are getting they are in better position to negotiate their own charges!
            </p>
            <p> 
				Health Cost Negotiator is a simple but powerful tool: it uses the Inpatient and Outpatient Medicare payment data and Hospital Referral Regions defined by the Dartmouth Atlas to show patients the average cost of a procedure in their referral region, state, and nationwide. This gives consumers at least three objective price points they can use to help negotiate a hospital charge.
